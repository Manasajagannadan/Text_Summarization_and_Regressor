# Digledge
Working with Text Summarization and find the loss, optimaization using Deep Learning model.
The DNNRegressor model giving the accurate results.
But i tried new model called Autoencoder for best accuracy. But i got poor accuracy and the result is not perfect. But here i am exploring my tried work.
The text summarazation results are good.


Commands required to run the codes:
1. pip install tensorflow (or)
2. pip install --upgrade tensorflow
3. pip install keras
4. pip install pandas
5. pip install matplotlib
6. pip install numpy

Digledge:
Task 1 : Allstate Claims Severity: 
By talking the DNNRegressor Model.ipynb file in DNNRegressor folder, 
1. Try to run the code in google colab or if not required try to run the code in jupyter notebook
2. Commands to run the code in Jupyter
  1. Change the path of .csv files like 'C:\Users\indian\Downloads\data\train.csv' and 'C:\Users\indian\Downloads\data\test.csv'
  2. Remaining code is good to run in jupyter notebook
  
By talking the Regression_Model.ipynb file in Regression Model folder,
1. Try to run the code in google colab or if not required try to run the code in jupyter notebook
2. Commands to run the code in Jupyter
  1. Change the path of .csv files like 'C:\Users\indian\Downloads\data\train.csv' and 'C:\Users\indian\Downloads\data\test.csv'
  2. Remaining code is good to run in jupyter notebook
  3. Model is also having good accuracy and for that i used Keras frame work.
  
By talking the Autoencoder Model New(By Manasa Jagannadan).ipynb file in Autoencoder folder,
1. Try to run the code in google colab or if not required try to run the code in jupyter notebook
2. Commands to run the code in Jupyter
  1. Change the path of .csv files like 'C:\Users\indian\Downloads\data\train.csv' and 'C:\Users\indian\Downloads\data\test.csv'
  2. Remaining code is good to run in jupyter notebook
  3. Model is not having good accuracy and for that i used Keras frame work.
  
Task 2 : Text Summarization: 
By talking the rfp_for_general_insurance.ipynb file in Extractive summarizer Method1 folder,
1. Try to run the code in google colab or if not required try to run the code in jupyter notebook
2. Commands to run the code in Jupyter
  1. pip install PyPDF2
  2. pip install docx2txt
  3. pip install --user -U nltk (or) pip install nltk
  4. Change the path of .pdf files like 'C:\Users\indian\Downloads\data\work\rfp_for_general_insurance.pdf'
  5. Remaining code is good to run in jupyter notebook
  6. Remaining all .pdf files having the same code only the files names need to change.
 
By talking the RFP_Corporate_Agency_Arrangement_for_Standalone_Health_Insurance_Business_with_SpaCy.ipynb file in Text Summarization Method2 with SpaCy folder,
1. Try to run the code in google colab or if not required try to run the code in jupyter notebook
2. Commands to run the code in Jupyter
  1. python -m pip install --upgrade pip
  2. python -m pip install spacy
  3. Change the path of .pdf files like 'C:\Users\indian\Downloads\data\work\RFP_Corporate_Agency_Arrangement_for_Standalone_Health_Insurance_Business.pdf'
  4. Remaining code is good to run in jupyter notebook
  5. Remaining all .pdf files having the same code only the files names need to change.
  
These are the changes need to observe to run the all ipynb and .py files.
